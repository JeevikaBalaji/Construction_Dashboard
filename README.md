## Introduction
This Construction Dashboard was built using **Power BI** to provide insights into project performance, timelines, costs, and resource management for construction projects. The dashboard helps stakeholders make data-driven decisions by offering real-time analysis on project progress and other KPIs.

## Key Features
- **Project Overview**: Displays the overall status of various construction projects.
- **Cost Analysis**: Shows the budget vs. actual costs for projects.
- **Timeline Management**: Visualizes project deadlines and timelines.
- **Resource Utilization**: Tracks resource allocation across projects.
- **Risk Assessment**: Highlights potential risks in project delays or budget overruns.
  
## Data Sources
The dashboard is connected to the following data sources:
- **Project Management Data**: Information about ongoing construction projects, including milestones, tasks, and deadlines.
- **Financial Data**: Budget, actual costs, expenses, and forecasts.
- **Resource Data**: Data on labor and materials allocated to each project.

## How to Use the Dashboard
1. **Navigate**: The dashboard consists of multiple tabs representing different aspects of construction project management (overview, costs, timelines, resources, risks).
2. **Filter**: Use the slicers provided to filter the data by project, time period, or specific resource categories.
3. **Drill Down**: Click on charts or tables to explore deeper insights, such as drilling down into individual project data or cost details.
4. **Export**: You can export reports in PDF format or other formats using Power BI's export feature.

## Installation and Setup
To view and use the Power BI Construction Dashboard:
1. Install **Power BI Desktop** from [Microsoft’s website](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/).
2. Download the `.pbix` file of the dashboard.
3. Open the `.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop.

5. Refresh the dashboard to get the latest insights.

If the dashboard is published on the Power BI service:
1. Access the dashboard by logging into your **Power BI Service** account.
2. Navigate to the shared workspace containing the Construction Dashboard.

## Visualizations
- **Project Status Overview**: A KPI card showing the completion percentage of each project.
- **Cost Variance Chart**: A bar chart comparing planned vs. actual expenses.
- **Gantt Chart**: Shows the timeline and progress of individual projects.
- **Resource Allocation Pie Chart**: Displays how resources (labor, materials) are distributed across projects.
- **Risk Analysis Heatmap**: Identifies high-risk areas for project overruns.
